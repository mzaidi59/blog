Why to write a blog??

You wake up on a Monday morning and a random thought crosses your mind. Suddenly, in your apartment, at a safe distance of atleast 2 floors and 2 days from any decent face to face human conversation, you are hit by Dejavu. You realize that you were thinking the exact same thing on last Monday, and probably on the one before that. You look back at the past few months of your life and realize that living alone has made it extremely difficult to keep track of things. It feels like one of those 'lost in the wild' stories where the person kept going in circles aimlessly. You take a thread to mark your location and start writing blogs, many of which might not be lucky enough to be displayed on the website, but that's not the point really.
